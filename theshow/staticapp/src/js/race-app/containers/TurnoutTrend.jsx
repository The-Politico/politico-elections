        Whether it&rsquo;s a midterm or a special election, fewer voters show up to the polls when they aren&rsquo;t voting for a president. That decrease in participation changes the electorate and may benefit one party more than another.

            This chart measures the change in the number of votes cast between the 2016 presidential election and this one. We compare that change with the same shift in the head-to-head vote split. Look for counties further in the corners of the chart. They are areas where a change in turnout different from most counties overwhelmingly benefited one party.

          note="
          Change in turnout in this chart is estimated using the percent change in the raw number of votes by county. Large changes in the number of registered voters in a county can affect how well that change represents a true change in turnout. Each county is displayed on this chart only after all its precincts have reported votes.
