# Census

## Creating census data

This app contains models and commands to create county-level census data files you can use in your dataviz.

Before you begin, make sure you have these environment variables set:

```
export AWS_S3_PUBLISH_BUCKET="com.politico.interactives.politico.com"
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<YOUR ACCESS KEY>"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<YOUR SECRET ACCESS KEY>"
```

### Steps

1. From the root of the `elections` project, startup the development server:

  ```
  $ python manage.py runserver
  ```

2. Login to the backend admin at `http://localhost:8000/admin`

3. Under Demographic, click to add a new Census Table.

4. Create the table you want using Census table and variable codes. (Use [Social Explorer](https://www.socialexplorer.com/explore/tables) to find the codes.) **Be sure to append an "E" to variable codes to get the census estimate, not the margin of error.** For example, `001E`.

5. Once you've created your table, you're ready to run the census command that will create your tables on the server. Specify states by FIPS codes to create county-level Census data files by state:

  ```
  $ python manage.py runserver 51 34
  ```
6. You can find your new data at a URL specified with this pattern:

  ```
  https://dy1ht16ivl5br.cloudfront.net/elections/data/us-census/{series code}/{table year}/{state fips}/{table code}.json
  ```

  For example:
  ```
  https://dy1ht16ivl5br.cloudfront.net/elections/data/us-census/acs5/2015/34/B03002.json
  ```
