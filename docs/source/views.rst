Page views
==========

Page views are constructed to support both a live preview and an export view that will be rendered to S3 when publishing an election.

View classes
''''''''''''

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    Cycle pages <views/cycles>
    State pages <views/states>
    Body pages <views/bodies>
    Race pages <views/races>
    Special election pages <views/specials>


Export Inheritance
''''''''''''''''''

To swap out key script references on the server once we bake out pages, each view class generally has a child that inherits from it. For example, if there is a :code:`RacePage` view, there will also be a :code:`RacePageExport` view.

The child view uses a template that also inherits from the parent's template, but overrides any resources that will be baked out.

For example, a parent template may reference a script on the server like this:

.. code-block:: python

  class RacePage(ClassView):
    template = 'page.html'

.. code-block:: jinja

  <!-- page.html -->

  {%block foot%}
  <script src="{% static 'theshow/js/app.js'%}"></script>
  {%endblock%}

... while the export view's template would override that reference with the script's URL on AWS:

.. code-block:: python

  class RacePageExport(RacePage):
    template = 'page.export.html'

.. code-block:: jinja

  <!-- page.export.html -->

  {% extends "page.html" %}

  {%block foot%}
  <script src="http://politico.com/election-results/cdn/{{election_day}}/js/app.js"></script>
  {%endblock%}


Static context builders
'''''''''''''''''''''''

To support exporting views in a management command, the parent view class has a static :code:`build_context` method that can return a context object. That context object should be enough to render the child template with the ``django.template.loader.render_to_string`` method when baking to AWS.
