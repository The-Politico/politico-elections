Bootstrapping a server
=======================

To bootstrap a new server, log into the AWS console and create a new EC2 server using the AMI for elections.

Once the server is bootstrapped and has an IP address, use the pem file in the `Private Eye repo <https://github.com/The-Politico/private-eye>`_ to login to the server as such:

::

  ssh ubuntu@ip-address-of-server -i path/to/private-eye/politico-east.pem


Once you’re in the server:

Get Your SSH key on there
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can't rely on your pem file to get into the server; Fabric depends on your SSH key having ssh access to run its commands. So you'll need to copy your SSH key to the server.

1. On your local machine, run :code:`pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
2. SSH into the server with the pem file, as above
3. :code:`nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` (or vi if that’s your thing)
4. Paste your ssh key on the bottom line
5. Save the file and disconnect from the server (:code:`ctrl+d`).
6. Try to ssh into the server with :code:`ssh ubuntu@ipaddress`

Getting the app on the server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Okay, now you’re ready to (attempt to) get the app on the server.

First, double check a few variables in :code:`server_config.py`. :code:`SERVER_PYTHON` should match the version you’re running, such as :code:`python3`. :code:`PRODUCTION_SERVERS`/:code:`STAGING_SERVERS` should have the IP addresses of the servers in the lists.

> For the following commands, :code:`staging` represents the server you want to target (either :code:`staging` or :code:`production`) and :code:`master` represents the branch you want to deploy.

Run :code:`fab staging master servers.setup`

Then, install the confs with :code:`fab staging master servers.deploy_confs`.

Check your site and see if it works! If you get an nginx error or it hangs, start checking your logs and welcome to server hell!

Updating the server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update the server with changes in the repo, first ensure that all of your changes are pushed to Github. Then, run :code:`fab staging master deploy_server`.

Running commands on the server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run any fab command on the server from your local machine, use :code:`servers.fabcast`. For example, if you want to run the :code:`data.bootstrap_db` command on the server, you would run:

::

  fab staging master servers.fabcast:data.bootstrap_db


Note that fabcast can only run fabric commands.

Upstart Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the server, the app basically functions through two upstart services: :code:`app` and :code:`deploy`. The :code:`app` service starts uWSGI to serve Django through nginx. The :code:`deploy` service runs the results daemon.

In the :code:`confs` folder, you will see the upstart configuration files for those two. Hopefully, you'll never need to touch them.

You can control them through Fabric. There are three commands:

1. :code:`fab staging master servers.start_service:name_of_service`
2. :code:`fab staging master servers.stop_service:name_of_service`
3. :code:`fab staging master servers.restart_service:name_of_service`
