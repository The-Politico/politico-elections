# elections


## Developing

### Starting up

##### Prereqs
 - Have PostgreSQL installed and a local database called `elections`
 - Have python3 installed
 - Have virtualenv installed

##### Steps

1. Clone this repo to a local directory
2. Start a virtualenv in the directory

  ```
  $ virtualenv -p python3 venv
  ```

3. Start the virtual environment

  ```
  $ source venv/bin/activate
  ```

4. Run initial migrations to create table.

  ```
  $ python manage.py migrate
  ```

5. Create a superuser

  ```
  $ python manage.py createsuperuser
  ```

6. Load sample data into the database:

  ```
  $ python manage.py loaddata geography entity
  ```

7. Move to `showtime/staticapp` directory and yarn install node dependencies.

  ```
  $ yarn
  ```

8. Run `gulp` to start developing.

  ```
  $ gulp
  ```

### Loading fixtures

Presumes you have installed node libraries `topojson` and `topojson-simplify`, globally.

1. Run these management commands in sequence:

  ```bash
  $ python manage.py load_geography
  $ python manage.py load_jurisdictions
  $ python manage.py load_fed
  ```

2. Bootstrap races, elections and candidates from the AP:

  ```bash
  $ python manage.py bootstrap 2017-11-07
  ```


### Getting results data

Presumes you have `AP_API_KEY` exported as an environment variable.

First, bootstrap the results data for a particular election

```bash
$ python manage.py bootstrap 2017-11-07
```

Then, get all of the race ids for each file you need to create

```bash
$ python manage.py prepare_races 2017-11-07
```

Finally, run the daemon that will get results every ten seconds

```bash
$ fab staging daemons.deploy
```
